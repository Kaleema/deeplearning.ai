Learn how to build and use knowledge graph systems to improve your retrieval augmented generation applications.

- Use Neo4jâ€™s query language Cypher to manage and retrieve data stored in knowledge graphs.
- Write knowledge graph queries that find and format text data to provide more relevant context to LLMs for Retrieval Augmented Generation.
- Build a question-answering system using Neo4j and LangChain to chat with a knowledge graph of structured text documents.
